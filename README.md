Hi,I'm @CPRenjoy67.
I'm interested in creating ideas to be useful for the event,and was hoping that we could have some more information about "turbo-rotary-phone" and if someone can take it in for an online store that would help me to find out how much I can afford to put in my life for the next few days,so if I can make a few changes.
I'm currently learning how to use GitHub for the program to get a better understanding and to put my thoughts into to "Turbo-Rotary-Phone" and then I will suggest ways that I can find.
👀 I'm looking to collaborate on this project it's a great opportunity 👌
