"# turbo-rotary-phone"
Hi, I'm @CPRenjoy67
I'm interested in creating ideas to be useful for the event, and I was hoping that we could have some information about the "turbo-rotary-phone" If someone can take it in for an online store that would help me to find out how much I can afford to put in my life for the next few days, so if I can make a few changes.
I'm currently learning how to use GitHub for the program to get a better understanding and to put my thoughts into "Turbo-Rotary-Phone" and then I will suggest ways that I can find.
I'm looking to collaborate on this project it's a great opportunity.
